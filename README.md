# 📚 About
* This dashboard is an edited version of <a href="https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2" target="_blank">Discord BOT Dashboard V2</a>, the Dashboard is made to make **Discord BOT Development and use** easy, designed to use and create applications while using a user friendly Web-Dashboard!

## 🧰 What more than in the V2 ?
In this version of the dashboard, 
* 🧑 **User** :
* You now have the option to connect without being an admin and get an access to the User Dashboard, 
* The User Dashboard let users manage the bot on their servers.
* 📋 **Little change** :
* If you don't have a profile picture for your account or your server, it will now put one of the basic one made by discord,
* A button on top of the "Logout" named "Administration Panel" only available for admins letting them use the Dashboard V2 to manage the bot ( all made by LachlanDev on the V2 ).
* 🔐 **Security** : 
* Unable for users to access the Administration Panel from the URL, auto redirect to the user dashboard. 


## 🚀 Installation / Setup
* Please refer to the README.md of <a href="https://github.com/LachlanDev/Discord-BOT-Dashboard-V2" target="_blank">the original Dashboard </a> for the setup of the dashboard.
